        <h1 class="h1">Teams</h1>
        A-team: Rotterdam Death Row Honeys
        The Rotterdam Death Row Honeys are fanatic athletes. They train hard for their
        place in the international rankings. You can find our rankings at
        <a href="http://flattrackstats.com/teams/18145">Flat track stats</a>
        <h1 class="h1">Rotterdam Killer Bees</h1>
        For the Bees being able to play equalizes fun. In July 2014 they played
        their first scrimmage against rival Amsterdam and are growing ever since.
        Some stay, some move up to the A-team.
        <h1 class="h1">Rofficials</h1>
        Want to keep skaters safe and make sure we are behaving? Want to know all
        about the rules? Don’t like to get hit? Become a Rofficial! Officials are
        often known as team “no fun”, but you can’t say that about our Rofficials!
        Of course they train to keep a straight face when they are calling our penalties,
        but they are also known to be quite fun during our joint scrimmage training and
        travel all over Europe to officiate games at other leagues.
        <h1 class="h1">Juvies</h1>
        If you’re totally new to skating and roller derby, we will first teach
        you the basics. While you’re learning, you’re in a group with others who are new.
        We call this group our ‘Juvies’ and try to teach you all we know before you join a team.
